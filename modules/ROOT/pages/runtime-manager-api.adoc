The Runtime Manager REST API enables you to programmatically access much of the functionality provided by Runtime Manager. To deploy Mule applications using the Runtime Manager REST API, see https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/arm-rest-services[REST APIs].

For a more complete reference of all the operations that are supported through the API, see https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/arm-rest-services/[API Reference 1.23].
